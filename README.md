# fancy-json-product-scraper

I want to create a json file of all valid products in Lindab by going through all article numbers starting at 950 to 1 000 000 with all products having the url path https://www.lindab.no/article/224939

The application should able to start at a user inputted number and persist the results for all numbers. Skip previously tested numbers. Save the URL for each valid hit. Use blue colour for the design. Give it a fancy title.
